# Daily Notes Feature

This feature allows viewing and managing daily notes within the main user panel.

## Service Layer (`tt-services`)

- The core logic resides in [tt-services/src/services/DailyNoteService.ts](mdc:tt-web/tt-services/src/services/DailyNoteService.ts).
- This service handles fetching today's note (creating it if it doesn't exist) and retrieving metadata for all daily notes.
- It relies on the base [tt-services/src/services/NotesService.ts](mdc:tt-web/tt-services/src/services/NotesService.ts) for storage and retrieval, identifying daily notes via the `daily-note` tag.
- The `DailyNoteService` is aggregated with other services in [tt-services/src/lib.ts](mdc:tt-web/tt-services/src/lib.ts).

## UI Layer (`tt-web`)

- The UI is integrated into the main panel section (`app/panel`).
- **Data Fetching:** The initial data (today's note, all metadata) is fetched server-side in [tt-web/app/panel/page.tsx](mdc:tt-web/tt-web/app/panel/page.tsx).
- **Tab Management:** The [tt-web/app/panel/PanelTabsClient.tsx](mdc:tt-web/tt-web/app/panel/PanelTabsClient.tsx) manages the different tabs in the panel, including the "Daily Note" tab, and passes down the necessary data.
- **Viewing/Navigation:** The [tt-web/app/panel/DailyNoteViewer.tsx](mdc:tt-web/tt-web/app/panel/DailyNoteViewer.tsx) component is responsible for:
    - Displaying the current daily note using [tt-web/app/panel/markdown-editor.tsx](mdc:tt-web/tt-web/app/panel/markdown-editor.tsx).
    - Providing Previous/Next day navigation buttons.
    - Showing a sidebar list of past daily notes for quick selection.
- **Server Actions:** When navigating between notes (via buttons or list), the `getNote` server action in [tt-web/app/panel/actions.ts](mdc:tt-web/tt-web/app/panel/actions.ts) is called to fetch the full note content.
